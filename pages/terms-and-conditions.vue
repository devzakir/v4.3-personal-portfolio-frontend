You may not use the Affiliate Program to earn money on your own Bohubrihi product accounts.
LINKS/GRAPHICS ON YOUR SITE, IN YOUR EMAILS, OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS
Once you have signed up for the Affiliate Program, you will be assigned a unique Affiliate Code. You are permitted to place links, banners, or other graphics we provide with your Affiliate Code on your site, in your emails, or in other communications. We will provide you with guidelines, link styles, and graphical artwork to use in linking to Bohubrihi. We may change the design of the artwork at any time without notice, but we won’t change the dimensions of the images without proper notice.

To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and referral fee accrual, we will provide you with special link formats to be used in all links between your site and the Bohubrihi. You must ensure that each of the links between your site and the Bohubrihi properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the Bohubrihi placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as “Special Links.” You will earn referral fees only with respect to sales on a Bohubrihi product occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you or someone you refer to use Special Links or incorrectly type your Affiliate Code, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement.

Affiliate links should point to the page of the product being promoted.

REFERRAL FEES/COMMISSIONS AND PAYMENT
For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other communications to https://www.bohubrihi.com and complete an order for a product during that session.

We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked and reported by our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone says they purchased or someone says they entered a referral code if it was not tracked by our system. We can only pay commissions on business generated through properly formatted special links that were automatically tracked by our systems.

We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.

Payments only begin once you’ve earned more than ৳2000 in affiliate income. If your affiliate account never crosses the ৳2000 threshold, your commissions will not be realized or paid. We are only responsible for paying accounts that have crossed the ৳2000 threshold.

IDENTIFYING YOURSELF AS A BOHUBRIHI AFFILIATE
You may not issue any press release with respect to this Agreement or your participation in the Program; such action may result in your termination from the Program. In addition, you may not in any manner misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you, say you develop our products, say you are part of Bohubrihi or express or imply any relationship or affiliation between us and you or any other person or entity except as expressly permitted by this Agreement (including by expressing or implying that we support, sponsor, endorse, or contribute money to any charity or other cause).

You may not purchase products through your affiliate links for your own use. Such purchases may result (in our sole discretion) in the withholding of referral fees and/or the termination of this Agreement.

PAYMENT SCHEDULE
As long as your current affiliate earning are over ৳2000, you’ll be paid each month. If you haven’t earned ৳2000 since your last payment, we’ll pay you the following month after you’ve crossed the threshold.

CUSTOMER DEFINITION
Customers who buy products through this Program will be deemed to be our customers. Accordingly, all of our rules, policies, and operating procedures concerning customer orders, customer service, and product sales will apply to those customers. We may change our policies and operating procedures at any time. For example, we will determine the prices to be charged for products sold under this Program in accordance with our own pricing policies. Product prices and availability may vary from time to time.
